# Student README file

The files I am submitting are:
For Problem 1:
ExpressionTree.java, MyStack.java and Problem1.java
For Problem 2:
AvlTree.java, FileAvl.java, and Problem2.java

Assumptions:
I used the MyStack.java class given in the solutions to HW2.
In AvlTree.java, I modified the insert method to take in a String and an int, 
and modified AvlNode to include a LinkedList, 
instead of writing a separate indexWord method.
I assumed the given MyStack class would handle the StackUnderflow error.

Running the code:
The code is run and compiled in the normal manner (javac filename.java for compile, java filename to run)
with the exception of Problem2.java, which takes in a file name as a command line argument.
