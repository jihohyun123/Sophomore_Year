# Student README file

The files I am submitting are: MyStack.java, SymbolBalance.java, 
TwoStackQueue.java, MyQueue.java, Problem2.java, Problem2.txt

Problem 1 is addressed by MyStack.java and SymbolBalance.java
Problem 2 is addressed by MyStack.java, TwoStackQueue.java, Problem2.java, MyQueue.java and Problem2.txt.

They are all compiled and run in the normal fashion: i.e., javac Problem2.java; java Problem2
The only exception in running is SymbolBalance.java, which takes in a file name in the command line argument:
ex. java SymbolBalance TestFiles/Test2.java

The only files with mains are SymbolBalance and Problem2. I didn't include TwoStackQueueTester.java
since that was given to us. I don't believe I made any assumptions or special errors; ideally the code
will run in the manner instructed in the assignment.
