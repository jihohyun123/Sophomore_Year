# Student README file
The files I am submitting are:
For Problem 1:
SpellChecker.java, Problem1.java
For Problem 2:
KBestCounter.java, KBest.java

The files are run and compiled normally, with the exception of Problem1.java
which takes in the command line argument the name of the file to be spell-checked.
