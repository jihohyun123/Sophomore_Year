Part 2:
--------
http-server.c compiles into http-server, which runs as instructed by the
lab instructions. part a runs without problems.
part b has a few problems:
If an item is searched that doesn't exist in mdb database,
an uninitialized value valgrind error results. Sometimes the page needs to be
refreshed after a while; it can send the entirety of the database on occasion,
but once it is refreshed the correct result comes up again. If the page hangs,
it must be refreshed.
